/* feel free to do any changes!
    here are few things need to be updated:
    1.  payment function. Should we(manager) send enough money to the contract in advance?
        I don't know what will happen if there is no enough balance.
    2.  how to start next round automatically?
    3.  Unfortunately, mapping cannot be cleared in solidity. So after the end, how can we clear all data?
*/
/* Update Roger:
    1. Introduced rounds: The lottery is able to manage rounds now. After a lottery "cycle" has finished another round starts automatically
        I did it with a mappig from rounds to betting numbers to ticketholders
    2. Automatic Payout after starting the lottery through the manager: When the manager starts the lottery, a random number gets
        drawn, the winners are assigned and the pricepool is paid out.
    3. The pricepool is acummulated with the price the players pay for a ticket. If somebody wins, the pricepool is paid out and set to 0.
